Coding convention
=================

I loosely follow the guide for linux kernel:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

In short,
        [1] 8 spaces for indentation
        [2] space around operators, like: bar = 3 + 4;

Convention for this program:
        Comments of "TODO" are inserted, for codes that are not fully implemented
